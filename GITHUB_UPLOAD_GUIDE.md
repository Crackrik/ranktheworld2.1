# 🚀 HOW TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB (STEP-BY-STEP)

## The Super Easy Way For Complete Beginners

### Step 1: Download These Files

You should have these files:
- `index.html` (the main page)
- `app.js` (the code that makes it work)
- `data.csv` (100,000 items to rank)
- `README.md` (description)
- `SETUP.md` (instructions)
- `LICENSE` (legal stuff)
- `.gitignore` (tells git what to ignore)

OR just use `rankeverything-repo.tar.gz` (all files in one zip)

   - OR click "choose your files" and select them all

3. Click "Clone Repository" 
4. Select your `rankeverything` repo
5. Copy all your files into that folder

### Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. In your repository, click **"Settings"** (tab at top)
2. Scroll down the left sidebar and click **"Pages"**
3. Under **"Source"**:
   - Branch: Select **"main"** (or "master")
   - Folder: Select **"/ (root)"**
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 6: Visit Your Site!

After 2-3 minutes, your site will be live at:

```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

For example, if your username is `coolperson123`, go to:
```

**Q: How much does this cost?**  
A: $0. GitHub Pages is free for public repositories.

**Q: What if I want to make it private?**

## Troubleshooting

**"My site shows a 404 error"**
- Wait 5 minutes (GitHub needs time to build it)
- Check Settings → Pages to see if it's enabled
- Make sure files are in the root folder (not in a subfolder)

**"It's blank/broken"**
- Make sure you uploaded ALL the files
- Check that `data.csv` is there
- Open browser console (F12) to see errors

**"I can't find the Settings tab"**
- You need to be logged in
- You need to be on YOUR repository page
- Settings is at the top right (after Code, Issues, Pull Requests)
